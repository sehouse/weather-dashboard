## Summary:

- This homework combines HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, plus the OpenWeather API, Bootstrap and moment.js to create a functioning weather dashboard. In the search field on the left, you input the name of the desired city. Once you click the search button, it adds the city to an array in local storage, appends it to a list below the search field, makes a request to OpenWeather for the city's weather information, and displays the weather for that city. The information displayed is for both the current day, and for the extended five day forecast. You can also recall previously searched city data by clicking on the name of the city under the search field.

## Features:

- Interactive search functionality.
- Ability to recall previous city searches.
- Ability to clear search data from local storage.
- Current weather forecast, including images, weather descriptions, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index.
- Extended five day forecast, including images, temperature, and humidity.
